Bring awareness up to your legs. Move the awareness to your chest and your breathing. Move the awareness to your arms and then down to your fingers. Last, bring awareness to your head and clear your thoughts."), MindfulAct(name: "Appreciation",  prompt: "Stop and consciously identify what you are able to appreciate in this moment. It could be something about yourself, another person, your enviornment, or what your body is sensing."), MindfulAct(name: "Look Up!", prompt: "Throughout your day, deliberately look up.

Take a deep breath in and make every muscle in your body tense - your toes, legs, fingers, arms, and face. Take a deep breath out and relax your body, turning all the energy off."), MindfulAct(name: "Stare at the Center", prompt: "Focus on the spinning circle in the center of the screen. Empty all other thoughts and focus."), MindfulAct(name: "Observe your thoughts", prompt: "Relax and think about whatever comes to your mind.

Become aware of the sensations on the bottoms of the feet, such as the pressure of the floor or ground beneath the feet, or the warmth or coolness of the feet. Do this whenever you begin to notice yourself becoming anxious or upset."), MindfulAct(name: "Release Anxiety", prompt: "Become aware of anxiety. Notice all the body sensations, emotions, and thoughts associated with anxiety. Notice when axiety makes an appearance in your day. Pause briefly to assess whether anxiety is present within you. You may also notice what makes anxiety worse, and what relieves it."), MindfulAct(name: "Notice Dislike", prompt: "Become aware of negative feelings you may have towards someone or something.
